5.3 Camel case: defined

Sometimes there is more than one reasonable way to convert an English phrase into camel case, such as when acronyms or unusual constructs like "IPv6" or "iOS" are present. To improve predictability, Google Style specifies the following (nearly) deterministic scheme.

Beginning with the prose form of the name:

Convert the phrase to plain ASCII and remove any apostrophes. For example, "MÃ¼ller's algorithm" might become "Muellers algorithm".
Divide this result into words, splitting on spaces and any remaining punctuation (typically hyphens).
Recommended: if any word already has a conventional camel-case appearance in common usage, split this into its constituent parts (e.g., "AdWords" becomes "ad words"). Note that a word such as "iOS" is not really in camel case per se; it defies any convention, so this recommendation does not apply.
Now lowercase everything (including acronyms), then uppercase only the first character of:
... each word, to yield upper camel case, or
... each word except the first, to yield lower camel case
Finally, join all the words into a single identifier.
Note that the casing of the original words is almost entirely disregarded. Examples:

Prose form	Correct	Incorrect
"XML HTTP request"	XmlHttpRequest	XMLHTTPRequest
"new customer ID"	newCustomerId	newCustomerID
"inner stopwatch"	innerStopwatch	innerStopWatch
"supports IPv6 on iOS?"	supportsIpv6OnIos	supportsIPv6OnIOS
"YouTube importer"	YouTubeImporter
YoutubeImporter*

*Acceptable, but not recommended.

Note: Some words are ambiguously hyphenated in the English language: for example "nonempty" and "non-empty" are both correct, so the method names checkNonempty and checkNonEmpty are likewise both correct.
